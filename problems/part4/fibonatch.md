### Problem Statement:

Write a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**Input:**

* An integer nn representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

**Output:**

* A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence up to nn terms.

**Example:**

**Input:**

n=5

**Expected Output:**

[0,1,1,2,3]

**Input:**

n=10

**Expected Output:**

[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
