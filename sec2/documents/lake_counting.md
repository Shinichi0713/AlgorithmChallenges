### Lake Counting Problem

You are given a 2D grid representing a map of a region. Each cell in the grid can either be land (`'L'`) or water (`'W'`). A lake is defined as a contiguous region of water cells connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). Your task is to count the number of distinct lakes in the grid.

#### Input

* The first line contains two integers, `N` and `M`, representing the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.
* The next `N` lines each contain `M` characters (`'L'` or `'W'`), representing the grid.

#### Output

* Output a single integer representing the number of distinct lakes in the grid.
